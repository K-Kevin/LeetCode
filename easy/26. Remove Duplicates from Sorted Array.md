### 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

`Easy`

https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/

Given a sorted array *nums*, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each element appear only *once* and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.

**Example 1:**

```
Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```js
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```



##### 解题：

使用快慢指针来记录遍历的坐标

-   开始时这两个指针都指向第一个数字
-   如果两个指针的数字相同，则快指针向前走一步
-   如果不同，则两个指针都向前走一步
-   当快指针走完整个数组后，慢指针加1就是不同的数字

~~~js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var removeDuplicates = function(nums) {
    const len = nums.length;
    if(len == 0) {
        return 0
    }
    let cur = 0
    for(let fast = 0; fast < len; fast ++) {
        if(nums[cur] != nums[fast]) {
            cur++
            nums[cur] = nums[fast]
        }
    }
    return cur + 1;
};
